To run the "brainwave" project using the provided package configuration, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check if it's installed by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   If not installed, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the project**: If you haven't already, clone the project repository or download the files.

### Instructions

1. **Navigate to the project directory**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the project is located. For instance:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/brainwave
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies listed in your `package.json`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

You can run different scripts provided in the `package.json`:

- **To start the development server**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This command starts the Vite development server, and you will typically access it through `http://localhost:3000` or the specified port in your terminal.

- **To build the project for production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This command builds the application and creates an optimized version in the `dist` folder.

- **To lint the code**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
  This command runs ESLint to check the code for issues according to the specified linting rules.

- **To preview the built project**:
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```
  This command serves the production build for local testing.

### Additional Notes:

- **Using Visual Studio Code or Any IDE**: If you are using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, you can open the project folder and utilize the integrated terminal to run the commands.
- **React Router**: Since you are using React Router, make sure your main component or app is set up to handle routes properly.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Ensure you have configured Tailwind CSS as per its documentation if you're planning to use it for styling.

Following these steps will help you successfully set up and run the "brainwave" project.
